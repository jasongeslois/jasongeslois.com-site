Tableau is just another tool that can be used in an epidemiologist's toolbox to help model, predict, and display disease data. Below are just a few things I have tried and find that they may be useful to someone else in their projects or career. 

This is what setting up diseases in a heat map format in Tableau can look like. This particular tool might be most useful to show hot spot areas that may need attention.

Here is an example using the previous post's data creating a geographic representation of legionella in Europe with this particular display. As you can see, it's a another great way to visualize disease rates.

Many factors can go into accurately predicting or making a disease forecast, but this was just one way I wanted to illustrate as a potential visual concept using forecasting tools available in the software.
