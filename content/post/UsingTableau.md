Tableau is just another tool that can be used in an epidemiologist's toolbox to help model, predict, and display disease data. Below are just a few things I have tried and find that they may be useful to someone else in their project or career. 

This is what setting up diseases in a heat map format in Tableau can look like.

Here is an example using the previous post's data mapping legionella in Europe with this particular display.

Many factors can go into looking or accurately predicting a disease forecast, but this was just one way I was exploring as a potential visual concept.
